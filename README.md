This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for both regression and classification tasks using two distinct datasets: the California Housing dataset and the Wine Quality dataset.

Regression Analysis: Using the California Housing dataset, the goal was to predict the median house value based on features such as housing median age, population, and median income. The project employed both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models. The Random Forest model achieved a higher accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.98 on the test set. Various performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared were used to evaluate the models.


Classification Task: Using the Wine Quality dataset, the objective was to classify wine samples based on physicochemical properties like acidity, alcohol content, and pH. The project explored Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers. Despite challenges with the class distribution, the models provided useful insights with confusion matrices and classification reports, achieving a classification accuracy of 44.5% using the Decision Tree model.


The project also focused on data preprocessing, including handling missing values and transforming categorical data. Extensive data visualization techniques, such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, were used to explore the relationships between features. The results were visualized through actual vs. predicted value plots for regression and confusion matrices for classification.

This project highlights how different machine learning algorithms can be applied to solve both regression and classification problems, demonstrating a wide range of analysis techniques and performance evaluation methods.
